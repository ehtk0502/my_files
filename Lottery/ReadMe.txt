This is a simple lottery application platform prototype. This platform is unique in a way that it uses Ethereum network to store and manage funds. This allows you to reach out to a variety of customers from anywhere in the world. Other non-trivial data is store in a relational database. In this project, I use MySQL. I programmed two web servers to implement a simple user interface where they can perform certain actions. The first one is a front-end web server where users can send in transactions to Ethereum Network and see how much fund is stored in the smart contract. The second server is an express back-end server that takes POST request and work with the database. The front-end react server uses Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing and a fetch request to achieve this.

The Solidity smart contract is tested using mocha.

While this platform has majority of the functionalities implemented, many others are missing. Furthermore, no security measures were taken into consideration while building the application.
