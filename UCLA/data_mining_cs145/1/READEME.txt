logisticRegression.py - contains the source code for batch gradient descent and newton ralphson method.
	it also has logics for calculating average log loss. Finally regularization was added to batch gradient 
	method for finding beta value. it was implemented within the coding section and if the section of the 
	code is not commented out, the output you see is regularized value.(in this code, it is commented out)

linearRegression.py - contains the source code for three method for calculating beta. methods include closed
	form, batch gradient, and stochastic gradient descent.

report- contains answer to the questions asked in homework.

README- description of the contents.

note:
a bit of outside of class research was needed for the homework.
