	nn.py:
		This file cotains the implementation of Neural Network training model using scikit-learn library.
	rf.py:
		This file cotains the implementation of Random Forest training model using scikit-learn library.
	data.py:
		This source file pre-processes the raw data and converts all features into numerical values.
	train_data.py:
		This source code generates train_data.csv for the training.
	predict_data.py:
		This source code generates predict_data.csv for the prediction.
Instruction:
	First, run data.py on business.csv. It will output a new csv called business_attributes.csv.
	Then, run train_data.py and predict_data.py which will output train_data.csv and predict_data.csv.
	nn.py uses train_data.csv and predict_data.csv to make prediction.
